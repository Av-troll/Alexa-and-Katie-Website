            <br>
            "I'm not a math problem, I don't have to make sense. But I do!"
            <br>
            "This is not a 'hmm' moment."
            <br>
            "I may have been a girl with cancer, but I was still me. Both things were true. And this is what I look like."
            <br>
            “I’ve never been sick in this room.”
            <br>

            "I kicked cancer's butt".
            <br>
            "Oh, you just did that."
            <br>
            " That's just wrong!"
